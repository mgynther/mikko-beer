# Mikko Beer

Mikko Beer is a hobby, learning and showcase web app by Mikko Gynther. See `backend` and `frontend` directories for backend and frontend, and also how to run them for development purposes.

The goal of this project is readable, testable and elegant code. Scope will most likely be limited compared to real-world applications but I will try to address also issues beyond the scope of this project in interfaces and code comments.
